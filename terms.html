      <h2>2. Privacy</h2>
      <p>PicMe may collect and use information about your usage of PicMe, including certain types of information from and about your device. PicMe may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to measure the use and performance of PicMe.</p>

      <h2>3. Limited License</h2>
      <p>PicMe grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use PicMe for your personal, non-commercial purposes. You may only use PicMe on Apple devices that you own or control and as permitted by the App Store Terms of Service.</p>

      <h2>4. Legal Compliance</h2>

      <h2>5. Objectionable Content Policy</h2>
      <p>Content may not be submitted to PicMe, who will moderate all content that has been flagged as inappropriate by users and ultimately decide whether or not to take down the post to the extent such content includes, is in conjunction with, or alongside any, Objectionable Content. Objectionable Content includes, but is not limited to: (i) sexually explicit materials; (ii) obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, violent and/or unlawful content or profanity; (iii) content that infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary right, or that is deceptive or fraudulent; (iv) content that promotes the use or sale of illegal or regulated substances, tobacco products, ammunition and/or firearms; and (v) gambling, including without limitation, any online casino, sports books, bingo or poker. If the content is deemed Objectionable Content, then we will take the content down and notify the creator of that content. If the user consistently, as deemed by PicMe, releases Objectionable Content, then PicMe reserves the right to ban that userâ€™s account indefinitely.</p>

      <h2>6. Warranty</h2>

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an admission that you may have such claims.</p>

      <h2>9. Third Party Intellectual Property Claims</h2>
